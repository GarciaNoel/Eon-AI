[TODO]

Start with a graph G that is a collection of points P.
Bag any groups of points that are element of P by adding a point b of points B to the graph that is connected to all selected elements of P.
add any random edge from every point in P to any point in B.
The DFVS algorithm should hence result in an empty graph.
